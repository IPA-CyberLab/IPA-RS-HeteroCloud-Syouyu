# Channel Artifact Publishing

The release workflow attaches `syouyu-release-artifact.json` containing
`schema_version: 1`, `component: "syouyu"`, the release version without
leading `v`, the full 40-character commit, and the pushed
`ghcr.io/ipa-cyberlab/ipa-rs-heterocloud-syouyu@sha256:...` image reference.
No example digest is a deployable artifact.

Before publication, the exact fully qualified release tag must resolve to both
the checked-out HEAD and GitHub release-event SHA. Tag syntax follows
HeteroNetwork's channel grammar; `+build` metadata is rejected before pushing.
Existing Rust, database, console (where present), and Helm gates remain.

Architecture jobs export their pushed digests. The manifest job validates both
results against this release and combines only immutable references, never
architecture tags. The final index digest comes from Buildx create's result
metadata; both platforms are checked by that digest before asset publication.
The chart remains packaged with the release version/appVersion overrides.

Dev releases such as `v0.1.71-dev.1` need not equal the source Cargo version.
Neither Dockerfile injects a release version into Rust compilation: binaries
retain their source Cargo version. OCI labels record the release version,
exact revision, and `io.heterocloud.cargo-version` separately. No source manifests
are rewritten. `latest` is updated only for a numeric stable version when the
GitHub release is explicitly not a prerelease.

Release asset uploads never overwrite existing assets. An existing channel
artifact rejects a repeat full run before building. A partially failed release
requires operator inspection; the workflow does not delete assets or silently
replace them. These checks do not make mutable registry tags immutable.

Publication does not select dev/prod, deploy workloads, or prove successful dev
testing. Stage the actual JSON using HeteroNetwork's existing channel tool;
review isolated-dev evidence before promoting the exact same artifact.
This JSON is not a publisher signature.
